DNSenum
To use DNSenum, simply specify the domain name that you want to enumerate. For example, to enumerate the DNS information for the domain example.com, 
you would use the following command:
  -dnsenum example.com
This will produce a list of all of the DNS records for the domain, as well as any other information that DNSenum can gather.
The DNSenum command also has a number of options that can be used to customize its behavior. For example, you can specify a different DNS server to use,
or you can tell DNSenum to skip certain operations.

DIG
The dig command is a powerful tool for querying DNS servers and gathering information about DNS records.
First, run the following command:
  -dig <target>
Then, once you have the DNS server, you can perform a DNS zone transfer by running
  -dig axfr @<DNS_SERVER> <target>
