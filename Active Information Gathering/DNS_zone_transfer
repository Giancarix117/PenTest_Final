DNSenum
To use DNSenum, simply specify the domain name that you want to enumerate. For example, to enumerate the DNS information for the domain example.com, 
you would use the following command:
  -dnsenum example.com
This will produce a list of all of the DNS records for the domain, as well as any other information that DNSenum can gather.
The DNSenum command also has a number of options that can be used to customize its behavior. For example, you can specify a different DNS server to use,
or you can tell DNSenum to skip certain operations.

DIG
The dig command is a powerful tool for querying DNS servers and gathering information about DNS records.
First, run the following command:
  -dig <target>
Then, once you have the DNS server, you can perform a DNS zone transfer by running
  -dig axfr @<DNS_SERVER> <target>


The fierce command on Kali is a DNS reconnaissance tool for locating non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It is a semi-lightweight scanner that can be used to gather information about a domain, including:

Subdomains
IP blocks
Wildcard DNS records
Zone transfer information
Fierce can be used to identify potential targets for further penetration testing, or to simply learn more about a domain. It is a valuable tool for security professionals and penetration testers.

To use the fierce command, simply specify the domain name that you want to enumerate. For example, to enumerate the DNS information for the domain example.com, you would use the following command:

fierce example.com
This will produce a list of all of the subdomains and IP addresses associated with the domain example.com, as well as any other information that fierce can gather.

The fierce command also has a number of options that can be used to customize its behavior. For example, you can specify a different DNS server to use, or you can tell fierce to skip certain operations. For more information on the fierce command and its options, please see the fierce man page.
