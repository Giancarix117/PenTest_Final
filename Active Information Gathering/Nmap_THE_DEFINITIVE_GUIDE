nmap -F <ip address> (Scans fewer ports)
nmap -sU <ip address> (UDP scan)
nmap -p- <ip address> (scan all 65k ports)
nmap -S <ip address> (Spoof from IP)
nmap -T <0-5> <ip address> (Set timing)
nmap -n <ip address> (no DNS)
nmap -6 <ip address> (IPv6 scan) 

nmap -sS <ip address> (stealth scan: taking advantage of TCP handshake and SYN packets and RST) 
nmap -sF <ip address> (low chance of logs scan: only using FIN flags to avoid IDS/Firewalls)
nmap -sN <ip address> (lower chance still: only uses packets with no flags set to test response)
nmap -sX <ip address> (Xmas scan: sends FIN, URG and PUSH flags, read books for more info!)
nmap -sA <ip address> (ACK scan: to be used in conjunction with other scans to detect firewall rules)
These scans donâ€™t tend to work on windows targets. Source: https://nmap.org/bennieston-tutorial/
