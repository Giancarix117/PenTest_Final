NMAP
Useful tool for port scanning


Netdiscover is a network scanner tool that can be used to discover active hosts on a local network. It works by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests
to all IP addresses on the network and listening for responses.When Netdiscover receives a response from a host, it records the host's IP address and MAC address.
