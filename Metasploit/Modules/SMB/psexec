The exploit/windows/smb/psexec module in Metasploit is a tool that leverages a vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB 
(Server Message Block) protocol to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a target Windows machine.

-use exploit/windows/smb/psexec

In order to use this, you will need a SMBUser and SMBPass, the best way to acquire these is by bruteforcing the SMB login. Once acquired, fill them in
-set SMBUser <user>
-set SMBPass <pass>
