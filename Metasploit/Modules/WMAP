Automates web server enumeration
Identifies vulnerabilities: It scans web applications and helps discover potential security weaknesses that attackers might exploit.

Common Vulnerabilities: WMAP focuses on finding common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations.
Metasploit Integration: WMAP integrates seamlessly with msfconsole, allowing you to leverage Metasploit's capabilities for web application security testing.

COMMANDS
-service postgresql start
-load wmap

First, we add a site as our target
-wmap_sites -a <TARGET>
We will also need to add the target IP address as a target site, this can be done by running the following command:
-wmap_targets -t http://<TARGET_IP>

you can view the available sites by running the following command:
-wmap_sites -l
You can also view the list of defined targets, this can be done by running the following command:
-wmap_targets -l

To run, use
-wmap_run -t

Now that we have been able to identify what modules can be run against the target web server, we can perform a web app vulnerability scan on the 
target by running the following command:
-wmap_run -e
