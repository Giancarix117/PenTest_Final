To spawn a bash shell using meterpreter, run the following command
- /bin/bash -i
It allows you to dynamically add routes to Metasploit's internal routing table within your active Meterpreter session. 
This is particularly useful for pivoting within a network, where you can leverage a compromised machine to access other networks it has access to.
-run autoroute -s <target_ip>
