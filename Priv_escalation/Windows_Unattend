We will run the powerup.ps1 Powershell script to find privilege escalation vulnerability. 
- Powershell.exe
- cd .\Desktop\PowerSploit\Privesc\
- ls
Now, we will Import PowerUp.ps1 script and Invoke-PrivescAudit function.
- . .\PowerUp.ps1
- Invoke-PrivescAudit
By importing the PowerUp.ps1 script and running the Invoke-PrivescAudit function, the user is essentially performing a comprehensive scan for potential privilege 
escalation vulnerabilities on the target system. This can be a valuable step in identifying and remediating security risks that could be exploited by attackers.

In this case, we found the Unattend.xml file present. This file is used when setting up windows initially, and it includes a password encrypted in base64 and the user name.
We can use this to gain admin privilege.
