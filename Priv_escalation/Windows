We will run the powerup.ps1 Powershell script to find privilege escalation vulnerability. 
- Powershell.exe
- cd .\Desktop\PowerSploit\Privesc\
- ls
Now, we will Import PowerUp.ps1 script and Invoke-PrivescAudit function.
- . .\PowerUp.ps1
- Invoke-PrivescAudit
By importing the PowerUp.ps1 script and running the Invoke-PrivescAudit function, the user is essentially performing a comprehensive scan for potential privilege 
escalation vulnerabilities on the target system. This can be a valuable step in identifying and remediating security risks that could be exploited by attackers.
