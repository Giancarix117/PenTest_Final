First, locate the binary. In this case we will use a binary called welcome as an example. Lets also pretend theres another
binary in the same directory called greetings.

Observe that the welcome binary has suid bit set (or on). This means that this binary
and its child processes will run with root privileges. Check the file type.
-file welcome
In this case, we can see its an ELF binary. 
Investigate the binary. The most easy or preliminary way of doing that is to use strings command.

-strings welcome
 After looking at the contents of the welcome file, we see that it is calling upon the greetings binary. 
We are going to replace the greetings binary with a bash file that will spawn a shell. Since its being executed by a binary
with root suid, it will spawn a shell with elevated privileges.
-rm greetings
-cp /bin/bash greetings

Now, if we execute the welcome binary, it will execute the greetings binary and grant us an elevated shell.
