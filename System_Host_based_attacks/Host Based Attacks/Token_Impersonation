After gaining access to a Windows server, we will impersonate a token in order to escalate in privilege. 
First, we will load the incognito plugin
  -load incognito

A bit of inof on the incognito module, 
The load incognito module in Metasploit is used to enable incognito capabilities for a Meterpreter session. Incognito is a collection of techniques that can be used to hide the presence of a Meterpreter session from security tools and other processes.

When the load incognito module is loaded, it provides a number of commands that can be used to perform incognito operations. These commands include:

list_tokens: Lists the available tokens on the target system.
impersonate_token: Impersonates a token, allowing the Meterpreter session to run with the privileges of the token's owner.
rev2self: Removes the Meterpreter session from the process list and replaces it with a copy of itself.
zombieprocess: Creates a zombie process that will run the Meterpreter session in the background.

AFTER LOADING THE PLUGIN
run the following command to list all available tokens
- list_tokens -u 
After seeing the available tokens, we can impersonate one to gain higher privs
-impersonate_token <token_name>
