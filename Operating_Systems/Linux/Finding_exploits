Linux Exploit Suggester (LES) is a tool designed to help you identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in Linux systems. It is a command-line tool that 
scans your system for publicly known Linux kernel exploits and suggests mitigation steps. LES can also be used to search for exploits for specific software 
packages.

Here is the repo and instructions https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester

There are multiple commands for LES. For example, to find kernel exploits, you would run
-sudo linux-exploit-suggester.sh --kernel

We can also upload the les.sh script into the victim and run it there in order to find the vulnerabilities.
