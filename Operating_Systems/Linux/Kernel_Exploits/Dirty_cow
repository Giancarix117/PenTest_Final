The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism used by the Linux kernel to manage memory. COW is a memory management 
technique that allows the kernel to share memory pages between different processes without duplicating the data. This is done by marking the page as read-only 
and only making a copy of the page when it is written to.

The Dirty Cow vulnerability occurs when two processes attempt to write to the same COW page at the same time. If the timing is just right, the kernel will not be
able to keep up with the writes, and the two processes will overwrite each other's data. This can allow a malicious process to overwrite the memory of another 
process, potentially gaining root privileges.
