Vulnerable Software
Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the dpkg -l command on Linux or look at C:\Program Files in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software, especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities.
