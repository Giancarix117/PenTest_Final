So! You have successfully hacked some poor soul. Good job! You must be proud of yourself ( I know i am :D)
But we cant get caught! We have to delete the bash history to make sure we stay stealthy af brah

Whenever you successfully gain access to a Linux target, all of your activity is being logged in the form of 
bash history. We can clear the bash history by running the following command:

-history -c

We can also clear the bash history by deleting the content of the .bash_history file. This can be done by running the following command:

-cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history

The command cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history is used to clear the Bash history file on a Linux or Unix system. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

cat /dev/null: This part reads data from the /dev/null device, which is a special file that discards all data written to it. In other words, it does nothing.
> ~/.bash_history: This part redirects the output of the previous command (which is nothing) to the file ~/.bash_history. This effectively overwrites the contents of 
this file with empty data, effectively clearing it.
