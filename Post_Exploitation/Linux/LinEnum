Now that we have explored how to use Metasploit modules to automate local enumeration on a Windows target, we can begin exploring how to use LinEnum.

LinEnum is a bash script that is used by penetration testers automate local enumeration and identify privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems.

In order to use this script, you will need to copy the script in to your lab environment. To begin with, you can access the script through the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

On the GitHub repo, navigate to the LinEnum.sh script as shown in the following screenshot.

You will then need to view the script in raw format, this can be done by clicking the raw button as shown in the following screenshot.
You will now need to copy the content of the script in raw format and paste it in to the lab environment clipboard.

Once you have copied the script from the GitHub repo, navigate back to the Kali Linux system in your lab environment and create a new file with a text editor like leafpad.

Then paste in the script you copied in the file, after which save the file as LinEnum.sh as shown in the following screenshots.

We can now navigate back to our meterpreter session and navigate to the tmp drive by running the following command:
-cd /tmp
We can now upload the *LinEnum.sh
* script we copied from the GitHub repo by running the following command:
-upload /root/Desktop/LinEnum.sh

We will now need to spawn a command shell session, this can be done by running the following command:
-shell
-/bin/bash -i

-chmod +x LinEnum.sh
-./LinEnum.sh
