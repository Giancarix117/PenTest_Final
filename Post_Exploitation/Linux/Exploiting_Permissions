There are some lazy admins out there, and for master hackers like us, it makes our life easier. 
The permissions of some files are not set properly
which can lead to problems. Search for such files and start from looking for world writable files.
A world writable file is the one for which every user has write permission/access.

Once we find a particular application we can run with sudo, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user. GTFOBins contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through sudo. 
We can search for the application we have sudo privilege over, and if it exists, it may
tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the sudo privilege we have.

Step 1: The following command will look for files (and not symlinks etc) which is world writable.
Command:
-find / -not -type l -perm -o+w

Step 2: In this case, we can observe from the result that /etc/shadow is world writable. Verify the same and also
check its contents.
Commands:
-ls -l /etc/shadow
-cat /etc/shadow

Step 3: Observe that root password is not set. By adding a known password in shadow file, one
can escalate to root. Use openssl to generate a password entry.
Command: openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password

Step 4: Copy the generate entry and add it to root record in /etc/shadow
it should look like this
-root:$1$abc$BXBqpb9BZcZhXLgbee.0s/:17764:0:99999:7:::
