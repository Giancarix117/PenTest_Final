YoYOYOYOYOOOOOOOOOOOO here is a lesson on how to create a cron job! So sick I know

First check the running process
-ps eaf

If Cron is running, this is what we do
Create a cron job which will use the SimpleHTTPServer python module to serve the files present in student 
userâ€™s home directory.


-echo "* * * * * cd /home/student/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer" > cron
-crontab -i cron
-crontab -l

Now, before moving forward i (gemini) will breakdown this command in cause your stupidass forgets, cause I aint gonna lie, its kinda wack. But this shit is crazy yo
1. echo: This command is used to print the given string to the standard output.
2. "* * * * * cd /home/student/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer": This is the string to be printed. It's a crontab entry that schedules a task to run every minute.
3. cd /home/student/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer, python -m SimpleHTTPServer: This starts a simple HTTP server using the built-in SimpleHTTPServer module in Python. 
This server will serve files from the current directory (which is now /home/student/).


Purpose:

This crontab entry will effectively set up a simple HTTP server on the system that will be accessible from any network device. Users can then browse the contents of the 
/home/student/ directory by visiting the server's IP address in a web browser. This can be useful for sharing files or testing web applications.

If you run a nmap, you will see the server is up and running.
This command will show  you the directory
-curl demo.ine.local:8000
If you want to curl a file, use this one
-curl demo.ine.local:8000/flag.txt
