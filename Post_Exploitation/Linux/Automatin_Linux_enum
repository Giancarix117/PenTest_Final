Now that we have gained access to the target system and have obtained a meterpreter session, we can begin the process of automating local enumeration through the use of various Metasploit post-exploitation modules.

To begin with, we can use the enum_configs module to enumerate various configuration files stored on the target system.

To get started, you will need to put the meterpreter session in the background. This can be done by running the following command:
-background

-use post/linux/gather/enum_configs

We will now need to configure the module optons, in this case, the only option that needs to be configured is the SESSION ID of the
meterpreter
session. This can be done by running the following command:

-set session 1
-run

the module will enumerate a list of configuration files on the Linux target that can be analyzed to learn more about the target system.

We can use the enum_network module to automate the enumeration of networking information from the target system.

We can now load the module by running the following command:

-use post/linux/gather/enum_network

The module will enumerate networking information from the target system and will store them in the local Metasploit loot directory.

As shown in the following screenshot, you can view the content of the configuration files by using the cat utility.

Another useful module is the enum_system module that can be used to automate the enumeration of local system information.

-use post/linux/gather/enum_system

We can also check if the target system is a virtual machine through the use of the checkvm module.
-use post/linux/gather/checkvm
