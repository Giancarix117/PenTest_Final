To begin with, we can enumerate the current user we have access to on the target system. This can be done by running the following meterpreter command:
-getuid

We can also enumerate the Windows privileges that the Administrator user has by running the following meterpreter command.
-getprivs

Another important piece of information to enumerate is to check the list of currently logged on users. This can be done through the use of a post-exploitation Metasploit module. In order to use it, 
you will need to put your current meterpreter session in the background by running the following command:
-background

after which we use
-use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users

after spawning a shell, we We can now enumerate the current user and the privileges this user has by running the following commands:

-whoami
-whoami/privs

We can get a list of user accounts on the system by running the following command:
-net users

We can learn more about the Administrator account by running the following command:
-net user administrator

Now that we have enumerated the users on the system, we can also enumerate the groups on the system by running the following command:
-net localgroup

We can also view the members of a particular group, for example, if we wanted to know what users were a part of the Administrators group, we can run the following command:
-net local group administrators
