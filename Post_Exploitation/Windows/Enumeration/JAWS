Now that we have explored how to use Metasploit modules to automate local enumeration on a Windows target, we can begin exploring how to use JAWS (Just Another Windows Enum Script).

JAWS is an open-source PowerShell script designed to help penetration testers automate local enumeration and identify privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems.

In order to use this script, you will need to copy the script in to your lab environment. To begin with, you can access the script through the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS


On the GitHub repo, navigate to the jaws-enum.ps1 script 
You will then need to view the script in raw format, this can be done by clicking the raw button 
You will now need to copy the content of the script in raw format and paste it in to the lab environment clipboard.

Once you have copied the script from the GitHub repo, navigate back to the Kali Linux system in your lab environment and create a new file with a text editor like leafpad.

Then paste in the script you copied in the file, after which save the file as jaws-enum.ps1.

We can now navigate back to our meterpreter session and navigate to the C:\ drive by running the following command:
-cd C:\\

We will then need to create the
Temp
directory by running the following command:
-mkdir Temp

After uploading the script successfully, we will need to spawn a command shell session, this can be done by running the following command:
-shell

We can now execute the
jaws-enum.ps1
script by running the following command:
-powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-Enum.txt

Note: JAWS will take a couple of minutes to complete the enumeration process, so do not be alarmed if the script looks like it has paused or stopped running.

Once the jaws-enum.ps1 script is done, we can download the output file for analysis, this can eb done by running the following command:
-download JAWS-Enum.txt
