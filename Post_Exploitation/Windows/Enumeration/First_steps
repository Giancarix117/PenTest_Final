To begin with, the most important information that should be obtained is the operating system running on the target system. This can be done by running the following meterpreter command:
-sysinfo

The sysinfo command also provides us with information like the hostname, OS architecture and the domain that the target system is a part of.

We can also enumerate the hostname of the system by spawning a native shell session on the target system, this can be done by running the following commands:
-shell
-hostname

In order to get comprehensive information regarding the target system, we can run the following command:
-systeminfo
This command will provide you with important information like the version of Windows running on the target, the OS build number, 
hardware configuration and most importantly the Windows HotFixes installed on the target system.

While the systeminfo command provides us with a list of installed updates in the form of their HotFix IDs, we can also get a list of installed updates on the system with more detailed information like 
when the update was installed by running the following command:

-wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
