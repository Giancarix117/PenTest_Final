To begin with, we can enumerate a list of running processes on the Windows target by running the following command in meterpreter:
-ps

We can also utilize meterpreter to search for specific processes that are of interest to you
, for example, if we wanted to locate identify the process ID (PID) of the explorer.exe process, we can run the following command
-pgrep explorer.exe

Another feature meterpreter provides is the ability to migrate to a different process via the PID. For example, we can migrate to the explorer.exe process by running the following command:
-migrate 2176

We can enumerate a list of running services by spawning a command shell session and running the following command:
-net start

We can learn more about the running services by running the following command:
-wmic service list brief

In addition to enumerating running processes and services, we can also enumerate a list of running tasks and the corresponding services for each task. This can be done by running the following command:
-tasklist /SVC

Another important piece of information to enumerate is the list of scheduled tasks on the Windows target, this can be done by running the following command:
-schtasks /query /fo LIST
