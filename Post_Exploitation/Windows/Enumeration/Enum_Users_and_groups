After upgrading to a meterpreter shell, he first piece of information that we can enumerate is the current user we have access to,
this can be done by running the following meterpreter command:
-getuid

We can also obtain the same information manually by running the following command in a command shell session:
-/bin/bash -i
-whoami

Now that we have identified the user account we have access to,
we can enumerate the groups that the root user is a prt of, this can be done by running the following command:
-groups root

We can get a list of other user and service accounts on the Linux system by running the following command:
-cat /etc/passwd

We can enumerate a list og groups present on the system by running the following command:
-groups 
We can view the users that are currently logged in by running the following command:
-who

We can also get a list of users of have recently logged in to the system by running the following command:
-lastlog
