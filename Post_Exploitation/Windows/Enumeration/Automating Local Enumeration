The first module we can explore is the
win_privs
module, which can be used to automate the enumeration of the current user privileges. We can load the module by running the following command:
-use post/windows/gather/win_privs

This module will enumerate the privileges of the current user you have access to on the target system and 
will provide you with useful information like whether the user is admin and whether UAC is enabled or disabled.

The next module we can use is the enum_logged_on_users which as the name suggests, enumerates a list of currently and previous logged on users. 
We can load the module by running the following command:
-use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users

We can also check if the target system is a virtual machine by leveraging a module called checkvm. This module will tell you whether the target system is a VM or container. 
We can load the module by running the following command:
-use post/windows/gather/checkvm

Another important module is the enum_applications module. This module enumerates a list of installed application/programs on the target system. 
We can load the module by running the following command:

-use post/windows/gather/enum_applications

the module enumerates a list of installed applications. This information is very useful as it can be used to search for vulnerabilities in the 
installed programs that can be leveraged or exploited to elevate your privileges or reveal important information. 
It also gives you an idea as to what this system is being used for.

We can utilize the enum_computers module to enumerate a list of computers connected to the same LAN that the target is a part of. 
We can load the module by running the following command:
-use post/windows/gather/enum_computers

We can also enumerate a list of installed updates and patches by using the enum_patches module.
-use post/windows/gather/enum_patches
