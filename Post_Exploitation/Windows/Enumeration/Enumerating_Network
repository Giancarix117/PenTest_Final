To begin with, the most important information that should be obtained are the network interfaces connected to the target as well as the respective IP addresses associated with said network interfaces. 
This can be done by spawning a command shell session and running the following command
-ifconfig

this command reveals that there is only one physical interface connected to the target and reveals the IP address associated with the network interface as well as the default gateway and subnet mask.

We can also obtain more information regarding the network interfaces by running the following command:
-ipconfig /all

As shown in the preceding screenshot, the ipconfig /all command reveals more information like the MAC address of the target system.

Another important piece of networking information to enumerate is the routing table, this information can be obtained by running the following command:

-route print

We can also display the arp cache to discover other IP addresses on the target network, this can be done by running the following command:
-arp -a

We can also view a list of open ports being used by services on the target system, this can be done by running the following command
-netstat -ano
