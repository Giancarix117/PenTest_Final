The first piece of information that we can enumerate is the Linux distribution and the OS architecture, 
this can be done by running the following meterpreter command:
-sysinfo

We can enumerate the hostname of the system by spawning a shell session and running the following commands:
-shell
-/bin/bash -i
-hostname

We can also identify the Linux distro name and release version manually by running the following commands:
-cat /etc/issue
-cat /etc/*release

The next piece of information we will need to identify is the version of the Linux kernel running on the target. This can be done by running the following command:

Command:
-uname -a

We can identify hardware information regarding the CPU being used on the target system by running the following command:
-lscpu

We can view the list of storage devices attached to the Linux system and information regarding their respective mount points and storage capacity by running the following command:
-df -h
