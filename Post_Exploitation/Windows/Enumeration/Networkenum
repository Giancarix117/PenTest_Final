The first piece of information that we can enumerate is the list of network interfaces connected to the target system and their respective IP addresses, 
this can be done by running the following meterpreter command:
-ifconfig

We can get a list of open ports on the target system by running the following meterpreter command:
-netstat

Another important piece of information to obtain is the routing table, this can be done by running the following command
-route

This information can also be gathered manually by spawning a shell session and running the following commands:
-ip a s

We can also enumerate the list of configured networks and their subnets by running the following command:

-cat /etc/networks

Most importantly, we can enumerate the list of locally mapped domains and their respective IP addresses by displaying the content of the /etc/hosts file.
-cat /etc/hosts

In order to identify the default DNS name server address, we can run the following command:
-cat /etc/resolv.conf
