What is the name of the Open (No Security) SSID present in the packet dump?
- (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0008) && (!(wlan.wfa.ie.wpa.version == 1)) && !(wlan.tag.number == 48)
Breakdown of the command
wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0008: This part of the filter selects beacon frames. 
!(wlan.wfa.ie.wpa.version == 1): This part of the filter excludes beacon frames that are using WPA encryption. 
!(wlan.tag.number == 48): This part of the filter excludes beacon frames that contain an RSN information element (IE).
TO FIND THE ANSWER, LOOK IN THE DATA FRAMES

The second query looks for management beacon frames.

What is the total count of packets which were either transmitted or received by the device with MAC e8:de:27:16:87:18?
-(wlan.ta == e8:de:27:16:87:18 || wlan.ra == e8:de:27:16:87:18)

What is the MAC address of the station which exchanged data packets with SSID SecurityTube_Open
First we find SSID SecurityTube_Open is hosted on BSSID e8:de:27:16:87:18
-((wlan.bssid == e8:de:27:16:87:18) ) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0020)
wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0020 this specifies that its a data frame

 From the last question, we know that a station was connected to SSID
'SecurityTube_Open'. Provide TSF timestamp of the association response sent from the
access point to this station.

(((wlan.bssid == e8:de:27:16:87:18)) && (wlan.addr==5c:51:88:31:a0:3b)) &&
(wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0001)
